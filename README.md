# ME_TownGenerator
A plugin to create town generation, like in Animal Crossing Wild World.

0% progress: (Not enough coffees)
In some entries of games like the sims and Animal Crossing, a town is generated out of nowhere at the start of a new game, placing shops, ponds, bridges trees, and house locations at random on a big map.  
This demo's aim is to replicate a similar behaviour with a plugin I plan on developing some day. This is a heavily taxing task for memory, and it will make saves take quite long to complete.  
It won't have plugin commands, it will be all parameters, and probably notetags.  

The only thing I didn't figure out just yet (should you try to make your own) is how will I place dynamic markers in the map.
